# Listed technical Assesment

## Task

You are provided with 2 basic screens Dashboard UI. You need to convert the high Fidelity design into code using React/Next and CSS/SASS/SCSS/LESS/Tailwind CSS.

## What you have to achieve

- Make a basic auth using Google (Login/Signup using google)
    - Resource: https://next-auth.js.org/
    - Design File Link: https://www.figma.com/file/gKLhBDaTmdNDzHjsvqFMmC/Front-End-Developer-Task?node-id=0-1&t=rJ4A60cFvrDoc5TE-0
- The dashboard should be pixel-perfect and look like a replica of the design.
- Donâ€™t blindly copy and paste the Figma inspect code. Use your skills to make it fit all screens.
- The charts should be working with some dummy data.
- Fetch the basic data using Axios/Fetch. (You can build an API or fetch json from public repo)
